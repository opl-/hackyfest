# Hackyfest

This is a repository for making Pull Requests for your contributions that for whatever reason don't count for Hacktoberfest.

This includes:

- Pull Requests that don't count because the maintainers for whatever reason didn't merge them in,
- Work done on projects where you didn't want to pollute the repository or commit log with unnecesary Pull Requests.


## Contributing

For your Pull Request to be accepted, it must add a single file to the repository under `user/<github username>/<short contribution description>.md` with the following contents:

```md
# Proof

Link(s) to a proof of contribution.

# Description

A brief description of what the contribution was.
```
